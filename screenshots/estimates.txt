1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

AZ Outage occurs
Alert triggers in - 5 minutes since error occurs
On-call staff is notified in - 1 min
On-call staff begins to diagnose issue - 10 min
DB is failed over to stand by instance - 10 mins. This doesn't require any administrative intervention as per user guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html)
On-call staff makes sure everything is working fine by restarting applications if required - 10 min

Total RTO - 25 min (10 mins to failover is included as it is an automated process)

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage

Region Outage occurs
Alert triggers in - 5 minutes since error occurs
On-call staff is notified in - 1 min
On-call staff begins to diagnose issue - 10 min
Promote the read replica in another to read/write replica - 15 min
Reconfigure and restart applications that write to db with the promoted db instance endpoint - 30 min

Total RTO - 1 hour


3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

Total RPO - 20 min. As per the AWS docs the failover time takes 60-120 secs but some large transactions can take some time.
Keeping a higher limit of 10 mins to do the failover. Additional 10 mins to make sure necessary applications are restarted and everything works fine.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
As RDS creates automated backups every 30 mins by default we will assume that we can restore to a version atleast 30 min old.

Region Outage occurs
Alert triggers in - 5 minutes since error occurs
On-call staff is notified in - 1 min
On-call staff begins to diagnose issue - 10 min
Promote the read replica in another to read/write replica - 15 min
Restore the promoted replica to point in time before primary region began to fail - 5 min
Reconfigure and restart applications that write to db with the promoted db instance endpoint - 30 min

Total RPO - 1 hour 30 min, considering that the backup will be atleast 30 min old.
